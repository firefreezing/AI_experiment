# AI Experiment
by firefreezing on Mar 15, 2018

This repo includes some programming code examples & notes during my AI learning. 

  + `/weights/` stores the pre-trained parameters of the models (simple though, at this moment)
  + `/tensorflow_example.py` - implementation of some simple/non-DNN mdoels using the TF framework
