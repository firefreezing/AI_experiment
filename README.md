This repo includes some programming code examples & notes during my AI learning. 

  + `/weights/` stores the pre-trained parameters of the models (simple though, at this moment)
  + `/tensorflow_example.py` - implementation of some simple/non-DNN mdoels using the TF framework
  + `/ffn_example_keras.py` - my first implementation using Keras. FFN + mnist data + tensorboard
  + `/ffn_example_tf.py` - FFN + mnist data + tensorboard
